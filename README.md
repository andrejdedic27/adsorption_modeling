Executing the program generates an adsorption_summary file, which contains the number of adsorption sites, arranged in order of decreasing stability. Additionally, the program creates three output files:
- ase_outputs 
- traj_files (tracking the progress and results of each optimization step)
- vasp_outputs (files suitable for visualization in programs like VESTA)
